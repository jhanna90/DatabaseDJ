### Conceptual Exercise

Answer the following questions below:

- What is PostgreSQL?  PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is known for its robustness, scalability, and adherence to SQL standards. It provides advanced features such as support for JSON, indexing, concurrency control, and extensibility. PostgreSQL allows users to efficiently store, manage, and retrieve structured data.

- What is the difference between SQL and PostgreSQL? SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language used to communicate with relational databases. It provides a standard syntax for querying, manipulating, and managing data in a relational database. PostgreSQL, on the other hand, is a specific implementation of an RDBMS that supports the SQL language. PostgreSQL extends SQL with additional features, functionality, and optimizations specific to its implementation.

- In `psql`, how do you connect to a database?  In the `psql` command-line tool, you can connect to a database by running the following command: `psql -d <database_name>`. Replace `<database_name>` with the name of the database you want to connect to. If the database is running on a remote server or requires authentication, you may need to provide additional connection parameters such as the host, port, username, and password.

- What is the difference between `HAVING` and `WHERE`? The `WHERE` clause is used in SQL to filter rows based on specific conditions. It is applied to individual rows before the grouping and aggregation take place. On the other hand, the `HAVING` clause is used to filter groups of rows after the grouping and aggregation have occurred, based on conditions involving the aggregated values. In other words, `WHERE` is used to filter individual rows, while `HAVING` is used to filter groups of rows.

- What is the difference between an `INNER` and `OUTER` join? In SQL, an `INNER JOIN` returns only the matching rows between two tables based on the specified join condition. It excludes rows that do not have a match in both tables. An `OUTER JOIN`, on the other hand, includes all rows from one or both tables, regardless of whether there is a match. If there is no match, the columns for the non-matching rows will contain null values.

- What is the difference between a `LEFT OUTER` and `RIGHT OUTER` join? Both `LEFT OUTER JOIN` and `RIGHT OUTER JOIN` are types of `OUTER JOIN`. The difference lies in which table's all rows are included in the result set. In a `LEFT OUTER JOIN`, all rows from the left (or first) table and the matching rows from the right (or second) table are included. If there is no match, the columns from the right table will contain null values. In a `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`, all rows from the right (or second) table and the matching rows from the left (or first) table are included. If there is no match, the columns from the left table will contain null values.

- What is an ORM? What do they do? An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a programming technique that allows developers to interact with a relational database using object-oriented programming languages. It maps the tables, rows, and columns of a database to objects, classes, and attributes in the programming language. An ORM abstracts away the low-level SQL queries and provides a higher-level API for performing database operations, such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting records. It simplifies database interactions and allows developers to work with databases using familiar programming paradigms.

- What are some differences between making HTTP requests using AJAX and from the server side using a library like `requests`? AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) allows making HTTP requests from the client-side (usually using JavaScript) without requiring a full page reload. It enables building dynamic and interactive web applications by asynchronously communicating with the server. On the other hand, making HTTP requests from the server-side using a library like requests is done on the server itself to interact with other APIs or services. It is typically used for server-to-server communication or fetching data before rendering a web page to be sent to the client.

AJAX requests are initiated from the client-side and can be triggered by user interactions or events on the web page. They are typically asynchronous, meaning the web page continues to function while waiting for the server's response. Server-side requests using requests, on the other hand, are initiated and executed on the server-side as part of the server's processing logic.

AJAX requests are subject to cross-origin restrictions enforced by the browser's security mechanisms, such as the same-origin policy. Server-side requests using requests are not restricted by cross-origin policies, as they are executed directly from the server.

- What is CSRF? What is the purpose of the CSRF token? CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is a type of attack where an attacker tricks a user's browser into making unintended malicious requests to a target website. To mitigate CSRF attacks, web applications often employ CSRF tokens. A CSRF token is a unique and random value that is generated by the server and included in forms or HTTP headers. The purpose of the CSRF token is to validate that the request originated from the same website and was not forged by an attacker. The token is checked by the server before processing the request, ensuring that it is legitimate and came from the expected source.

- What is the purpose of `form.hidden_tag()`? In Flask-WTF, `form.hidden_tag()` is used to generate HTML code for a hidden input field containing a CSRF token. This function is typically used in forms that require CSRF protection. The purpose of the CSRF token is to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks. By including the hidden CSRF token in the form, the server can verify the token's authenticity when the form is submitted, ensuring that the request is legitimate and not forged by an attacker.
